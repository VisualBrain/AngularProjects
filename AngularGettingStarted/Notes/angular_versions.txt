Custom Pipe: pure vs impure
           Pure: only evaluated when input changes
           Impure:evaluated on every change detection cycle
RxJS -
    Promises vs Observables
    Self subscribe or not
    Forgetting to subscribe
    Marking multiple http requests
    Hot vs cold Observables
    Shared Observables
Server Side Rendering Modes - Full pre-render - quick in response
                            - Dynamic pre-render - whenever web server receive a request,webpages are built by angular universal.
Zone.js -> state change detection
     Change Detection = state change => re-render=> cascading changes => re-render
     Zone.JS is a combination of all of this phases
